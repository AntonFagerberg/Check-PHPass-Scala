Scala implementation of Portable PHP password hashing. (crypt_private password check only!)
Written by Anton Fagerberg <anton at antonfagerberg dot com>, 2012.

Based on the original code from Portable PHP password hashing framework
written by Solar Designer <solar at openwall.com>.
Original PHP implementation: http://www.openwall.com/phpass/

Note that this code has not been peer-reviewed and any potential user should proceed with
caution before implementing this in a production system. With that said, I have tested the code myself
and used it in production.

The cryptPrivate method is used in phpass when CRYPT_BLOWFISH and CRYPT_EXT_DES
is not available in PHP. This piece of Scala code can verify those passwords.
